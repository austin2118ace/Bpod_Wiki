# Contributing

Thank you for considering a contribution to the Bpod Wiki!

# How to contribute
1. Make a [fork](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/about-forks) of the [develop branch](https://github.com/sanworks/Bpod_Wiki/tree/develop) of Bpod_Wiki.
2. [Clone](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository) your fork to create a local copy of it on your machine.
3. Make any updates or additions to the docs, and [commit](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/committing-changes-to-your-project/creating-and-editing-commits/about-commits) the changes to your fork.
4. [Push](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/using-git/pushing-commits-to-a-remote-repository) your updated local fork to its remote location on Github.
5. Create a [pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests) for us to integrate your changes into the project.

# Style Guidelines
The Bpod Wiki is formatted in [Github-flavored markdown](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github). We recognize that neuroscience researchers are often beyond busy with research, and we do not want contributions to our tools be hindered in any way. If you are time constrained, please ensure that your contributed code works as intended, and we will make any necessary style edits on our part before the next stable release.

# Important Notes About Contributing
- We request that all contributions comply with the terms specified in [CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md](/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) in this folder.

- The master branch of Bpod_Wiki contains the latest curated release. We kindly request that you submit your pull request against the 'develop' branch of Bpod_Wiki, so that we can review the docs before they are added to the default resource for everyone. Pull requests made against 'master' will be closed, with a request to resubmit against 'develop'. Thank you!

- We deeply appreciate the time and effort you have invested in your contribution! Please take a moment to reach out to us at admin@sanworks.io, so that our core dev team can personally thank you for being a contributing member of the Bpod community!
